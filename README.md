My name is Matt.

I focus on software soloutions for niche problems, particularly around the Audio-Visual control and integration field.

If you're here, i'm guessing you saw one of those niche projects.  

You might also enjoy some of the other projects I created and maintain, including:
- [REST API Microservice for Extron Devices](https://github.com/Dartmouth-OpenAV/microservice-extron-sis)
- [REST API Microservice for APC Switched Power Distribution Units](https://github.com/Dartmouth-OpenAV/microservice-apc-pdu)
